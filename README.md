# Fake-news-Detection-using-Deep-learning
In this study, we used BERT's word embedding to provide the best contextual representations of words. 
Through experimental procedures, we propose models based on models that can accurately detect fake news by using the headline and the news article 
using the headline and the news article, these sequences will first be passed into Bert, and then this output will be fed into the various deep-learning architectures 
deep learning architectures such as CNN LSTM GRU BILSTM and (CNN LSTM). Our contribution proposes a new hybrid deep learning model (BERT RCNN Variant) that combines convolutional and recurrent neural networks for 
classification. Our models perform reasonably well for the classification of fake news.
